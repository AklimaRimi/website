Praying mantis insects, tiny snakes, and toads are examples of other animal species that consume grasshoppers. It is possible to lessen or get rid of grasshopper infestations by using gardening techniques that promote these natural predators.</p>

            Large numbers of grasshoppers can be consumed by chickens, and birds wandering your garden can almost completely control grasshoppers and other insects. This purpose is also served by other domestic birds, such as ducks and geese.
